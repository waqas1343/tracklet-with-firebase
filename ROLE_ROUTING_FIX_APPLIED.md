# Role-Based Routing Fix Applied ✅

## 🐛 Issue Identified

**Problem:** All users were being routed to Distributor dashboard regardless of their actual role in Firestore.

**Root Cause:** The `UserModel.fromJson()` method in Tracklet app was failing to parse the role string from Firestore:
- Firestore stores: `"gas_plant"` (snake_case)  
- Enum expects: `UserRole.gasPlant` (camelCase)
- The parsing logic was looking for exact match `"UserRole.gas_plant"` but enum is `UserRole.gasPlant`
- Result: Always defaulted to `UserRole.distributor`

---

## ✅ Fix Applied

### 1. Updated `tracklet/lib/core/models/user_model.dart`
**Changed the role parsing logic to handle both formats:**
```dart
factory UserModel.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
  // Parse role from Firestore string to enum
  UserRole parsedRole = UserRole.distributor; // default
  final roleString = json['role']?.toString().toLowerCase() ?? '';
  
  if (roleString == 'gas_plant' || roleString == 'gasplant') {
    parsedRole = UserRole.gasPlant;
  } else if (roleString == 'distributor') {
    parsedRole = UserRole.distributor;
  }
  
  return UserModel(
    // ... rest of model
    role: parsedRole,
  );
}
```

### 2. Added Debug Logging
Added comprehensive debug prints to track the role flow:

**Login Screen (`login_screen.dart`):**
```dart
print('🔍 Login - User role from Firestore: ${userData['role']}');
print('🔍 Login - Parsed UserRole enum: ${user.role}');
print('✅ Login - Setting role to GAS PLANT/DISTRIBUTOR');
```

**UserRoleProvider (`user_role_provider.dart`):**
```dart
print('💾 UserRoleProvider - Setting role: $role');
print('💾 UserRoleProvider - Saving to storage: $roleString');
```

**UnifiedMainScreen (`unified_main_screen.dart`):**
```dart
print('🏠 UnifiedMainScreen - Current role: ${userRoleProvider.currentRole}');
print('✅ Loading GAS PLANT screens (5 tabs)' or 'DISTRIBUTOR screens (4 tabs)');
```

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### Test 1: Gas Plant User Login

1. **Create Gas Plant User (Super Admin):**
   ```
   Open Super Admin app
   Login: agha@tracklet.com / 123123
   Create User:
     - Email: gasplant@test.com
     - Role: GAS PLANT
     - Company: Test Gas Company
     - Address: 123 Test St
   ```

2. **Login to Tracklet:**
   ```

   Password: 123123
   ```

3. **Expected Console Output:**
   ```
   🔍 Login - User role from Firestore: gas_plant
   🔍 Login - Parsed UserRole enum: UserRole.gasPlant
   ✅ Login - Setting role to GAS PLANT
   💾 UserRoleProvider - Setting role: UserRole.gasPlant
   💾 UserRoleProvider - Saving to storage: gasPlant
   ✅ UserRoleProvider - Role saved successfully
   🏠 UnifiedMainScreen - Current role: UserRole.gasPlant
   📱 _getPages called with role: UserRole.gasPlant
   ✅ Loading GAS PLANT screens (5 tabs)
   ```

4. **Expected UI:**
   - ✅ Gas Plant Dashboard displayed
   - ✅ Bottom nav shows 5 tabs:
     1. Dashboard
     2. Gas Rate
     3. Orders
     4. Expenses
     5. Settings

### Test 2: Distributor User Login

1. **Create Distributor User (Super Admin):**
   ```
   Open Super Admin app
   Login: agha@tracklet.com / 123123
   Create User:
     - Email: distributor@test.com
     - Role: DISTRIBUTOR
   ```

2. **Login to Tracklet:**
   ```
   Email: distributor@test.com
   Password: 123123
   ```

3. **Expected Console Output:**
   ```
   🔍 Login - User role from Firestore: distributor
   🔍 Login - Parsed UserRole enum: UserRole.distributor
   ✅ Login - Setting role to DISTRIBUTOR
   💾 UserRoleProvider - Setting role: UserRole.distributor
   💾 UserRoleProvider - Saving to storage: distributor
   ✅ UserRoleProvider - Role saved successfully
   🏠 UnifiedMainScreen - Current role: UserRole.distributor
   📱 _getPages called with role: UserRole.distributor
   ✅ Loading DISTRIBUTOR screens (4 tabs)
   ```

4. **Expected UI:**
   - ✅ Distributor Dashboard displayed
   - ✅ Bottom nav shows 4 tabs:
     1. Dashboard
     2. Orders
     3. Drivers
     4. Settings

---

### Test 3: Switch Between Users

1. **Login as Gas Plant user**
   - Verify Gas Plant dashboard (5 tabs)

2. **Logout and login as Distributor user**
   - Verify Distributor dashboard (4 tabs)

3. **Switch back to Gas Plant**
   - Verify Gas Plant dashboard again

**Expected:** Each login should show the correct dashboard based on the user's role.
