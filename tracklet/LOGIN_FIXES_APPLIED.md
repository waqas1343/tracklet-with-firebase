# Login Issues Resolution - Tracklet App

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Missing FirebaseService Provider** ✅
**Problem:** `FirebaseService` was initialized but not provided to the widget tree, causing login screen to crash when trying to access it via `Provider.of<FirebaseService>()`.

**Solution:** Added `FirebaseService` to the provider tree:
- Updated `app_provider.dart` to include `FirebaseService` import
- Added `firebaseService` parameter to `AppProvider` constructor
- Added `Provider<FirebaseService>.value(value: firebaseService)` to providers list
- Updated `main.dart` to pass `firebaseService` to `AppProvider`

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/core/providers/app_provider.dart`
- `lib/main.dart`

---

### 2. **Google Services Plugin Configuration** ✅
**Problem:** Google Services plugin was not configured in the root-level build.gradle.kts.

**Solution:** Added Google Services plugin declaration:
```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.google.gms.google-services") version "4.4.4" apply false
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `android/build.gradle.kts`

### 3. **Super Admin Account Creation Missing Firestore Data** ✅
**Problem:** When creating accounts via Super Admin app's "Create Account" dialog, users were only created in Firebase Authentication but not in Firestore, causing "User data not found" errors during login.

**Solution:** Added Firestore data saving after account creation:
```dart
// Save user data to Firestore
await FirebaseFirestore.instance
    .collection('users')
    .doc(userCredential.user!.uid)
    .set({
  'id': userCredential.user!.uid,
  'email': email,
  'role': 'distributor', // default role
  'createdAt': DateTime.now().toIso8601String(),
});
```

**Files Modified:**
- `super_admin/lib/features/admin/views/admin_login_screen.dart`

---

## ✅ Verified Working Features

### Login Flow
1. ✅ User enters email + password
2. ✅ Firebase Auth verifies credentials
3. ✅ App fetches user document from Firestore `users` collection
4. ✅ Role is read from Firestore (`distributor` or `gas_plant`)
5. ✅ User is navigated to appropriate dashboard

### Role-Based Dashboard Routing
- ✅ **Distributor role** → Distributor Dashboard (4 tabs)
  - Dashboard
  - Orders
  - Drivers
  - Settings

- ✅ **Gas Plant role** → Gas Plant Dashboard (5 tabs)
  - Dashboard
  - Gas Rate
  - Orders
  - Expenses
  - Settings

### Firebase Integration
- ✅ Firebase Core initialized
- ✅ Firebase Auth working
- ✅ Cloud Firestore connected
- ✅ Google Services configured
